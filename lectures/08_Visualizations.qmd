## Looking Ahead

-   Plan to have 2 more labs that will be similar to the last lab

    -   Likely take place on 10/25 and sometime the week of 11/13

-   Outside of these labs, I am going to plan on having additional mini-labs

    -   Likely to take place on 11/1, 11/22 and 11/29 (will update based on how things are going in class)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Today...

Working with `ggplot2` to get some really fancy visualizations!

Maybe integrating some generative AI (ChatGPT) to help us out too

```{r, results = 'hide', message = F, warning = F}
# File management
library(here)
# for dplyr, ggplot2
library(tidyverse)
#Loading data
library(rio)

#for the penguins dataset
#install.packages('palmerpenguins')
library(palmerpenguins)

#Remove Scientific Notation 
options(scipen=999)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Take a look at the data

Will be using a dataset from the `palmerpenguins` library ([link](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html#exploring-distributions)) which is a dataset about...[penguins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GnLDJAgrws). This function will pull that data into our environment:

```{r}
data(penguins)
```

Now we can get some descriptive statistics:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_flipper = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE),
    std_flipper = sd(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
    std_mass = sd(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE), 
    cor_flip_mass = cor(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g)
  )
```

# `ggplot2`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `ggplot2` from the `tidyverse`

Since we have already installed and loaded the library, we don't have to do anything else at this point!

`ggplot2` follows the "grammar of graphics"

-   Theoretical framework for creating data visualizations
-   Breaks the process down into separate components:

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Data

Aesthetics (`aes`)

Geometric Objects (`geoms`)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Faceting

Themes
:::

# `ggplot2` [cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-visualization.pdf)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `ggplot2` syntax {.smaller}

There is a basic structure to create a plot within `ggplot2`, and consists of at least these three things:

1.  A Data Set
2.  Coordinate System
3.  Geoms - visual marks to represent the data points

In R it looks like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))

#or how I like to do it
<DATA> %>% 
  ggplot(aes(<MAPPINGS>)) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `ggplot2` syntax

Let's start with a basic figure with `palmerpenguins`

**First** we will define the data that we are using and the variables we are visualizing

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#the dataset is called penguins

penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
             y = body_mass_g))
```

What happens?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We forgot to tell it what to do with the data!

Need to add the appropriate `geom` to have it plot points for each observation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
             y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_point()
```

***\
Note:*** the `geom_point()` layer will inherit what is in the `aes()` in the previous layer

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Adding in Color

Maybe we would like to have each of the points colored by their respective `species`

This information will be added to the `aes()` within the `geom_point()` layer

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
             y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = species))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Including a fit line

Why don't we put in a line that represents the relationship between these variables?

We will want to add another layer/geom

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
             y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = species)) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

\
That looks a little wonky...why is that? Did you get a note in the console?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Including a fit line

The `geom_smooth()` defaults to using a loess line to fit to the data

In order to update that, we need to change some of the defaults for that layer and specify that we want a "linear model" or `lm` function to the data

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
             y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = species)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

\
Did that look a little better?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Individual fit lines

It might make more sense to have individual lines for each of the species instead of something that is across all

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
             y = body_mass_g, 
             color = species)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

\
What did we move around from the last set of code?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Updating Labels/Title

It will default to including the variable names as the `x` and `y` labels, but that isn't something that makes sense. Also would be good to have a title!

We add on another layer called `labs()` for our labels ([link](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html))

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
             y = body_mass_g, 
             color = species)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') + 
  labs(
    title = "Palmer Penguins",
    subtitle = "Body Mass by Flipper Length", 
    x = "Flipper Length (mm)", 
    y = "Body Mass (g)", 
    color = "Species"
  )
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Penguin Histogram

Taken from the website for `palmerpenguins` ([link](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html#exploring-distributions))

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(fill = species), 
                   alpha = 0.5, 
                   position = "identity")
```

# Example 2

I have uploaded three datasets. I would like us to explore the datasets together to see what is going on with them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Three Datasets

```{r}
data1 <- import()
```

three datasets

compare on descriptive stats

then visualize

```{r}
state_school <- import("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dharaden/dharaden.github.io/main/data/NM-NY_CAS.csv")
```

# Next time...

-   Visualizing with ggplot

-   Parameterization of reports (not using "magic numbers")
