------------------------------------------------------------------------

### $\chi^2$ test of independence or association

The previous tests that we conducted last class, we were focused on the way our data (NY Students Superpower Preferences) "fit" to the data of an expected distribution (US Student Superpower Preferences)

Although this could be interesting, sometimes we have two categorical variables that we want to compare to one another

-   How do types of traffic stops differ by the gender identity of the police officer?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's take a look at a scenario:

We are part of a delivery company called Planet Express

![](/images/Planet_express.webp){fig-align="center" width="192"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's take a look at a scenario:

We are part of a delivery company called Planet Express

We have been tasked to deliver a package to Chapek 9

![](/images/Chapek_9.webp){fig-align="center" width="192"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's take a look at a scenario:

We are part of a delivery company called Planet Express

We have been tasked to deliver a package to Chapek 9

Unfortunately, the planet is inhabited completely by robots and humans are not allowed

In order to deliver the package, we have to go through the guard gate and prove that we are able to gain access

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### At the guard gate

> *(Robot Voice)*
>
> WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING WOULD YOU MOST PREFER?
>
> A: A Puppy
>
> B: A pretty flower from your sweetie
>
> C: A large properly-formatted data file
>
> CHOOSE NOW!

-   Clearly an ingenious test that will catch any imposters!
-   ***But what if humans and robots have similar preferences?***

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Luckily, I have connections with Chapek 9 and we can see if there are any similarities between the responses.

Let's work through how to do a $\chi^2$ test of independence (or association)

First, we have to load in the data:

```{r}
chapek9 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dharaden/dharaden.github.io/main/data/chapek9.csv") %>% 
  mutate(choice = as.factor(choice), 
         species = as.factor(species))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Chapek 9 Data

Take a peek at the data:

```{r}
head(chapek9)
# or 
#glimpse(chapek9)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chapek 9 Data

Look at the summary stats for the data:

```{r}
summary(chapek9) 
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chapek 9 Data - Cross Tabs

There are a few different ways to look at these tables. We can use `xtabs()`

```{r}
chapekFreq <- xtabs( ~ choice + species, data = chapek9)
chapekFreq
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Constructing Hypotheses

Research hypothesis states that "humans and robots answer the question in different ways"

Now our notation has two subscript values?? What torture is this??

![](/images/Greek_breakdown.PNG){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Constructing Hypotheses

Once we have this established, we can take a look at the null

![](/images/Null_prob.PNG){fig-align="center"}

-   Claiming now that the true choice probabilities don't depend on the species making the choice ( $P_i$ )

-   However, we don't know what the ***expected*** probability would be for each answer choice

    -   We have to calculate the totals of each row/column

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chapek 9 Data - Cross Tabs

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Let's use R to make the table look fancy and calculate the totals for us!

We will use the library `sjPlot` ([link](https://strengejacke.github.io/sjPlot/reference/index.html#descriptive-statistics-tables))

**Note:** Will need to knit the document to get this table

```{r, results='asis', message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#| codefold: TRUE

library(sjPlot)

tab_xtab(var.row = chapek9$choice, 
          var.col = chapek9$species, 
         title = "Chapek 9 Frequencies")

```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, results='asis', message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

library(sjPlot)

tab_xtab(var.row = chapek9$choice, 
          var.col = chapek9$species, 
         title = "Chapek 9 Frequencies")

```
:::
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Note about degrees of freedom

Degrees of freedom comes from the number of data points that you have, minus the number of constraints

-   Using contingency tables (or cross-tabs), the data points we have are $rows * columns$

-   There will be two constraints and $df = (rows-1) * (columns-1)$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We now have all the pieces for a $classic$ Null Hypothesis Significance Test

But we have these computers, so why not use them?

Using the `associationTest()` from the `lsr` library

```{r}
lsr::associationTest(formula = ~choice+species,
                data = chapek9)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe we want to keep it traditional and use `chisq.test()` will there be a difference?

[Book Ch 12.6 - The most typical way to do a chi-square test in R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/chisquare.html#chisq.test)

```{r}
chi <- chisq.test(table(chapek9$choice, chapek9$species))
chi
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

But what if we want to visualize it? Use `sjPlot` again

```{r}
plot_xtab(chapek9$choice, 
          chapek9$species)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's clean that up a little bit more

```{r}
plot_xtab(chapek9$choice, chapek9$species, margin = "row", bar.pos = "stack", coord.flip = TRUE)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Writing it up

> Pearson\'s $\chi^2$ revealed a significant association between species and choice ( $\chi^2 (2) =$ 10.7, $p$ \< .01), such that robots appeared to be more likely to say that they prefer flowers, but the humans were more likely to say they prefer data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assumptions of the test

-   The expected frequencies are rather large

-   Data are independent of one another

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Comparing Means

When we move from categorical outcomes to variables measured on an interval or ratio scale, we become interested in means rather than frequencies. Comparing means is usually done with the *t*-test, of which there are several forms.

The one-sample *t*-test is appropriate when a single sample mean is compared to a population mean but the population standard deviation is unknown. A sample estimate of the population standard deviation is used instead. The appropriate sampling distribution is the t-distribution, with N-1 degrees of freedom.

$$t_{df=N-1} = \frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\frac{\hat{\sigma}}{\sqrt{N}}}$$

The heavier tails of the t-distribution, especially for small N, are the penalty we pay for having to estimate the population standard deviation from the sample.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## One-sample *t*-tests

*t*-tests were developed by William Sealy Gosset, who was a chemist studying the grains used in making beer. (He worked for Guinness.)

-   Specifically, he wanted to know whether particular strains of grain made better or worse beer than the standard.

-   He developed the *t*-test, to test small samples of beer against a population with an unknown standard deviation.

    -   Probably had input from Karl Pearson and Ronald Fisher

-   Published this as "Student" because Guinness didn't want these tests tied to the production of beer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Load in the dataset from last class

```{r}
school <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dharaden/dharaden.github.io/main/data/example2-chisq.csv") %>% 
  mutate(Score_in_memory_game = as.numeric(Score_in_memory_game))
school <- school %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Score_in_memory_game))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### One-sample *t*-tests vs Z-test

|                                             | Z-test                    | *t*-test                        |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| $\large{\mu}$                               | known                     | known                           |
| $\sigma$                                    | known                     | unknown                         |
| sem or $\sigma_M$                           | $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}$ | $\frac{\hat{\sigma}}{\sqrt{N}}$ |
| Probability distribution                    | standard normal           | $t$                             |
| DF                                          | none                      | $N-1$                           |
| Tails                                       | One or two                | One or two                      |
| Critical value $(\alpha = .05, two-tailed)$ | 1.96                      | Depends on DF                   |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Assumptions of the one-sample *t*-test**

**Normality.** We assume the sampling distribution of the mean is normally distributed. Under what two conditions can we be assured that this is true?

**Independence.** Observations in the dataset are not associated with one another. Put another way, collecting a score from Participant A doesn't tell me anything about what Participant B will say. How can we be safe in this assumption?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### A brief example

Using the same Census at School data, we find that New York students who participated in a memory game ( $N = 224$ ) completed the game in an average time of 44.2 seconds ( $s = 15.3$ ). We know that the average US student completed the game in 45.04 seconds. How do our students compare?

**Hypotheses**

$H_0: \mu = 45.05$

$H_1: \mu \neq 45.05$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
$$\mu = 45.05$$

$$N = 227$$

$$ \bar{X} = 44.2 $$

$$ s = 15.3 $$
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
t.test(x = school$Score_in_memory_game, 
       mu = 45.05,
       alternative = "two.sided")
```
:::
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
lsr::oneSampleTTest(x = school$Score_in_memory_game,
                    mu = 45.05, one.sided = FALSE)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cohen's D

Cohen suggested one of the most common effect size estimates---the standardized mean difference---useful when comparing a group mean to a population mean or two group means to each other.

$$\delta = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_0}{\sigma} \approx d = \frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\hat{\sigma}}$$

Cohen's d is in the standard deviation (Z) metric.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cohens's d for these data is .05. In other words, the sample mean differs from the population mean by .05 standard deviation units.

Cohen (1988) suggests the following guidelines for interpreting the size of d:

::: nonincremental
-   .2 = Small

-   .5 = Medium

-   .8 = Large

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The usefulness of the one-sample *t*-test

How often will you conducted a one-sample *t*-test on raw data?

-   (Probably) never

How often will you come across one-sample *t*-tests?

-   (Probably) a lot!

The one-sample *t*-test is used to test coefficients in a model.

#Load sleep data: https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html
sleep <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dharaden/dharaden.github.io/main/data/sleepstudy.csv")
model = lm(Reaction ~ Days, data = sleep)
summary(model)
```
